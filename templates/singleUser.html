<!-- We will also add a singleUser.html template that will be used to display
only the blogs associated with a single given author. It will be used when we dynamically
generate a page using a GET request with a user query parameter on the /blog route (similar to how we
dynamically generated individual blog entry pages in the last assignment). -->
